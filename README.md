# Variational Inference for Monte Carlo objectives (VIMCO)

This repository contains all the code necessary to reproduce the results of the [VIMCO](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06725) paper using Theano. This code follows the original implementation as closely as possible. For 5 samples it obtains a better score than what is mentioned in the original paper (-91.7 vs -93.6).

Usage for CPU:

```
python main.py experiment/
```

Usage for GPU (with GPU also responsible for rendering desktop):

```
THEANO_FLAGS=device=gpu,floatX=float32,lib.cnmem=0.8 python main.py experiment/
```

Usage for GPU (with GPU running headless and needing no memory for desktop):

```
THEANO_FLAGS=device=gpu,floatX=float32,lib.cnmem=1 python main.py experiment/
```

Expected output:

```

E means Epoch, S means Steps (as reported in the original paper), L means Log-likelihood (paper reports negative log-likelihood, which is just a sign flip) and T means Time in seconds. ~11 seconds is the runtime on a GTX 750 gpu with an Athlon II X3 425 triple core processor, on a Titan X the performance will likely be much better.

To compute a score on the test set:

```
THEANO_FLAGS=device=gpu,floatX=float32,lib.cnmem=0.8 python main.py experiment/ --test
```


After 2000 epochs this leads to a variational lower bound on the test set of -91.65 for 5 samples, see also the [config file](experiment/parameters.cfg) (VIMCO paper obtains -93.6).


To run the experiment with other hyper parameters, one only needs to change the [config file](experiment/parameters.cfg).

#### Notes on implementations:
The sampling is implemented separately from forward/backward for gradients. This leads to computing the forward of the inference (q) network twice, which is not optimally efficient. Also the first activation is computed on a replicated batch, an alternative is to just compute the first activation for the original batch and then sample for "repeat" amount of times. The result can be reshaped and used in further computation.


#### List of files:

- [main.py](main.py) contains the code that runs everything. It supports the -r/--restart flag for restarting despite of saved parameters and -t/--test flag for computing the score on the test set and then exiting
- [VIMCO.py](VIMCO.py) contains the VIMCO specific code including the novel estimator
- [Model.py](Model.py) contains general model code, such as initialization of parameters, Adam updates and loading/saving of parameters.
- [SBN.py](SBN.py) contains train/test/valid functions and compiles the full Theano functions.
- [utils.py](utils.py): contains some useful utilities that are class independent
